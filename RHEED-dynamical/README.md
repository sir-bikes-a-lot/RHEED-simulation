RHEED dynamical diffraction simulation utilizing the embedded R-matrix calculations as outlined in:
A. Ichimiya and P. I. Cohen, "Dynamical theory - embedded R-matrix method",
Chapter 13 in "Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction", Cambridge University Press (2004).

Code is under active development. MATLAB script "dev.m" contains function calls to load the crystal
structure, specified either as a VASP POSCAR file or as a molecular dynamics dump file, and calculate
the diffracted intensity pattern based on the embedded R-matrix method.
